## Overview

The ECU is a critical component in modern vehicles, responsible for monitoring and controlling various electrical systems. This project demonstrates a basic implementation of an ECU using:

1. **Arduino** for low-level, real-time controls.
2. **Raspberry Pi** for more complex computation and communication tasks.

Both projects are written in **C/C++** for maximum performance and control.

---

## Features

- **Arduino Project:**

  - Low-level hardware control.
  - Real-time processing of sensor data.
  - Actuator management.

- **Raspberry Pi Project:**
  - Data aggregation and analysis.
  - Communication with external systems (e.g., CAN bus or cloud).
  - Advanced computation and logging.

## Installation

### Arduino

1. Open the `Arduino/main` folder in the Arduino IDE.
2. Compile and upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

### Raspberry Pi

1. Connect through SSH to the Raspberry.
2. Connect through SFTP also.
3. Navigate to the `Raspberry` folder:
   ```bash
   cd Raspberry/
   ```
4. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
5. Run the program:
   ```bash
   sudo ./ecu
   ```
